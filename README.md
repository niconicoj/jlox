## JLox : Lox interpreter

This is where I keep the Lox interpreter I am building following the https://craftinginterpreters.com/ book. This is the java version (as you might have seen).

## How to use

You can compile the project by running :

```
make build
```

you will need a jdk for that.

You can then run the interpeter with a command like :
```
java -cp bin/ Lox
```
